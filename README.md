Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for Codeanywhere. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Codeanywhere and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **March 3rd, 2023**

Add credit to love-running project for icon script, nav bar funcitonality
credit fontawesome for icons



TO DO:
FIX RESPONSIVENESS ISSUE WITH THE VIDEO ON THE HOMEPAGE WHEN VIEWING IT ON A PHONE

FIX IMAGES IN THE MAPS TAB -> Fixed by changing link to image (removing / at the start) <- add to buggs>
ALSO TEST ON LAPTOP -> done seems resonably well designed for slightly smaller sizes


Layout:

Blurp -> What's the website about, essentially a sales pitch

example: Love Running is a site that hopes to help keep people motivated to meet up for runs on a regular basis in Dublin, Ireland. The site will be targeted toward runners who are looking for a way to socialise and keep themselves fit. Love Running will be useful for runners to see exactly when and where they should be to join the running club.


Features - > Describe each feature (where it is, what it does, what it's purpose is) Include screenshots of each feature.

Features left to implement - > Anything I still want to add, if any

Testing -> How did I test my site:
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Validator Testing HTML
No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
CSS
No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator
Unfixed Bugs
You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.
