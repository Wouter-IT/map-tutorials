## Wireframes

The Wireframes for FakeFairytale Battle Maps were made using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com) as the UI proved to be intuitive and easy to grasp. There are wireframes for two separate devices; Full-Screen and Mobile.
The final design of the website varies slightly from the wireframes in some regards as during the process it was discovered the design could be simplified without the loss of clarity.

## Design & Color Scheme

### Typography
The typography that were chosen for the project were <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bebas+Neue" target="_blank">Bebas Neue</a> for the headers and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat" target="_blank">Montserrat</a> with a fall-back on sans-serif as body text. Bebas Neue was chosen because it already was the main font of the FakeFairytale brand and it suits the role as header well. It is described ad bold and draws in the eyes to the headers to help guide a visitor through the page. Montserrat was chose as body and navigation text based on the recommendation from <a href="https://typ.io/fonts/bebas_neue#:~:text=Bebas%20Neue%20is%20a%20sans,Calluna%2C%20Avenir%20and%20Playfair%20Display." target="_blank">Typ.io</a> as a suitable match. It also has a clean look that'se asy to read and thus suited for explanatory texts.

### Color Palette

The color scheme chosen is based on the FakeFairytale brand and the colors it employs in it's YouTube channel and logo. However, as those colors were not necessarily designed for the use of a website some minor changes have been made to address that. The original green-grey color has been darkened slightly to increase contrast. Alternatively the red has been derived from the Gnomes Hat in the logo, and the slightly off-black color has been chosen to better match the soft colors already in the palate.
